/// signatures, tool search results, compaction and fallback blocks and fields this
/// SDK does not model included, in their key order (`RawJSON`). The one sanctioned
/// rewrite is the API's own compaction at the end of a turn (`replaceWithSummary`).
/// The one merge is `pushUserText`'s, into a user message the API never answered.
