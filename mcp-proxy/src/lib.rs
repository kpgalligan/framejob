#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! `reelcut_mcp` — the stdio MCP server bundled as
//! `Reelcut.app/Contents/Helpers/reelcut-mcp` (road map 14's MC3, spec §11
//! MC-3, MC-4, MC-6). An MCP client starts it; it speaks newline-delimited
//! JSON-RPC on stdin and stdout and reaches the running app over the agent
//! server's Unix socket. It answers `initialize` and `ping` itself, answers
//! `tools/list` from the app when one answers and from its bundle's catalog
//! snapshot when none does, and launches its own bundle in the background
//! on the first `tools/call` that finds no socket.
//!
//! stdout carries protocol only; anything else this process says goes to
//! stderr, each line starting `reelcut-mcp: ` (never `Reelcut: `, the
//! parity check's prefix). The module map is `mcp-proxy/CLAUDE.md`.
