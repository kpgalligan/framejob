# CLAUDE.md

Reelcut — a screencast-style video editor for macOS: a Swift/AppKit UI over a
Rust staticlib core, the same shape as `~/devel/rasterize`.

**It builds and runs.** M1 (Cut) is done and verified against spec §10; most
of M2 landed with it. `designs/reelcut-design.md` is still normative for the
schemas (§5), the op table (§6) and the architecture (§7) — read those before
changing either side. §10 is the milestone list, §11 the settled decisions.

## Commands

```sh
make app        # cargo build --release + xcodegen + xcodebuild → build/Build/Products/Release/Reelcut.app
make test       # cd core && cargo test --release  (103 black-box tests)
make lint       # cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make typecheck  # swiftc -typecheck of app/Sources/*.swift — the ONLY authoritative Swift check
make project    # xcodegen generate (Reelcut.xcodeproj is generated; project.yml is the source of truth)
make run        # make app, then launch
```

`make typecheck` is fast and catches nearly everything; run it before
`make app` (~90 s). Rust changes need `make test` and `make lint` too.
`make typecheck` currently reports 6 AVFoundation deprecation warnings and
0 errors — the deprecations are deliberate (their replacements are
`async`-only, and `async` is confined to `MediaImporter.swift`).

## File map

```
core/                Rust staticlib — the model, the ops, the plan, the recipe,
  include/…_core.h     export settings, the generic MCP server. THE FFI CONTRACT
  src/                 model time edit(+_clip/_props/_track/_time) actions
                       transition evaluate audio snap format export agent ffi*
  tests/               black-box, through the FFI (core/CLAUDE.md)
app/
  Sources/             AppKit app, programmatic UI (app/CLAUDE.md has the map)
  Resources/Shaders/   Compositor.metal — the per-layer compositing pass
  Bridging/            the bridging header importing core/include/reelcut_core.h
designs/             reelcut-design.md — normative spec
project.yml          xcodegen definition; Makefile; README.md (user-facing)
```

Per-side detail lives in `core/CLAUDE.md` and `app/CLAUDE.md`. Read the one
for the side you are editing before writing code; do not duplicate it here.

## Rules

- Conventions are Rasterize's — `~/devel/rasterize`'s three `CLAUDE.md`
  files are the parent text for anything not settled here.
- **Rust decides, AVFoundation and Metal do** (spec §7). No pixel or sample
  work in Rust; no ffmpeg dependency in the product.
- **The FFI is three files in lockstep**: a Rust `#[no_mangle]` export, its
  entry in `core/include/reelcut_core.h`, and its wrapper in
  `app/Sources/ReelCore.swift`. Persisted-state changes bump
  `RC_FORMAT_VERSION` in both `core/src/format.rs` and the header.
- **`app/Sources/ReelCore.swift` is the only file that calls `rc_*`.** Edits
  are JSON ops through `rc_project_apply`. The op table is the module doc of
  `core/src/edit.rs`; `ReelCore.swift`'s typed builders and
  `AgentCatalog.swift`'s tools both mirror it, and spec §6 mirrors it again —
  change one, change all four.
- **Every edit is pure and returns `Option`** (identity or a documented
  refusal = `None`, no undo step). `ProjectDocument` is the single mutation
  point and undo is its stack of handles.
- **Every user-visible edit gets an MCP mirror** (spec §7.9): a handler, a
  catalog entry, and a comment naming the UI path. The startup parity check
  in `AgentServer.start()` enforces the names.

## Verifying a build

The app is verified by driving the built binary over MCP and comparing
`render_frame` output — not by reading code. Launch your own instance on your
own port and only ever kill that one (`pgrep -f "MacOS/Reelcut"` lists them;
another session may have one running):

```sh
make app
(RC_AGENT_PORT=4817 ./build/Build/Products/Release/Reelcut.app/Contents/MacOS/Reelcut \
   -ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES -AgentServerEnabled YES > /tmp/reelcut-4817.log 2>&1 &)
```

The log line names the port it actually bound (a taken port falls back to an
ephemeral one). Then drive it with any MCP client over streamable HTTP at
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` — 50 tools: one per §6 op plus `open_project`,
`new_project`, `save_project`, `get_project`, `import_media`, `set_playhead`,
`set_range`, `undo`, `redo`, `render_frame` and `export`.
`render_frame` writes a PNG and returns its path, so a script can diff it
against `ffmpeg`-extracted source frames; `export` waits for the file.

Spec §10's per-step verifications are the acceptance tests. Steps 3, 4, 5, 7,
9, 10, 11 and 12 have been run against a built app and passed; 1 and 2 are
what `make app` and `make test` check every time. **Steps 6 (timeline view)
and 8 (canvas overlay) are visual and have never been checked by anyone**, and
neither has step 4's "the clip plays with audio" or step 5's 60 fps — MCP
cannot see the screen. Those need eyes on the app.

## Milestone status

- **M1 — Cut: done.** Open a movie into an untitled project at its size and
  rate, import, tracks, move/trim/split/delete/ripple, playback and JKL,
  transform/crop/opacity, markers, `.reelcut` save/open, undo, H.264 and HEVC
  export.
- **M2 — Compose: done but for chapters.** Text, shapes, transitions, audio
  volume/fade/duck/detach, freeze frame, speed, in/out range, and the MCP
  agent all work through the ops, the inspector, and the Add Text / Add Shape
  toolbar buttons (`EditorViewController+AddClips.swift`, which places on the
  front track and falls back to a new one when the overlap rule refuses).
  Still owed: chapters on export — a `chapter: true` marker writes no chapter
  track (measured: `ffprobe -show_chapters` on the export is empty). That is
  part of the `AVAssetWriter` seam `Exporter.swift` documents, which spec §7.8
  puts in M2's second half; `AVAssetExportSession` cannot write one.
- **M3 — Polish: part done.** In: actions (evaluated in `actions.rs`) plus
  corner radius, shadow, colour controls and chroma key, which all render
  through `Compositor.metal`. Not started: nests (`Source::Nest` parses but
  `evaluate.rs` filters it out of every recipe), filters, reflection,
  spotlight, GIF/APNG export, noise removal, SRT captions, Consolidate Media,
  ffmpeg-assisted import.

Keep this file current as code lands.
